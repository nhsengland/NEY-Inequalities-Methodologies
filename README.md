# NEY-Inequalities-Methodologies
This is a repository which outlines methodologies used by the NHSE North East and Yorkshire Analytics Team for analysing healthcare metrics by deprivation. All of the underlying R code used for calculations and visualisations is available in the 'Functions.R' file.

The work builds on recommendations from the NHSE Healthcare Inequalities Improvement Programme and their 'How to Guide' for constructing a health inequalities metric, which is available on their [FutureNHS page](https://future.nhs.uk/InequalitiesImprovement/view?objectId=164231013).
